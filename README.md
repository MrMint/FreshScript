# FreshScript

Now... this is a list all about how  
My tasks got flipped-turned upside down  
And I'd like to take a minute just sit right there  
I'll tell you how I became the prince of a tool called Jir air

### Step 1: Install a script manager

* Firefox: [Greasemonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-us/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/)
* Whatever monkey suits your browser 

### Step 2: Install the script!
